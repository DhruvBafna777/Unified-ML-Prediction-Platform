- **Interactive UI:** Built with Streamlit for real-time user interaction.
- **Data Visualization:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to easily add new models in the future.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **ML Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Model Handling:** Joblib

## 📂 Modules & Applications
1.  **Car Resale Price Prediction:** Estimates value based on year, mileage, and condition.
2.  **Diamond Price Estimation:** Predicts price based on carat, cut, color, and clarity.
3.  **Insurance Premium Calculation:** Analyzes risk factors to determine premiums.
4.  **Customer Purchase Prediction:** Classifies whether a customer will buy a product.
